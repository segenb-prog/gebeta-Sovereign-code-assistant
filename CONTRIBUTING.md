Secret Scanning (Pre-commit Hook)

To prevent accidental commits of secrets, we recommend installing gitleaks:

```bash
# Install gitleaks (macOS)
brew install gitleaks

# Install gitleaks (Linux)
curl -sSfL https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases/latest/download/gitleaks_linux_x64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv gitleaks /usr/local/bin/

# Run locally before committing
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose
```

Add the following pre-commit hook (.git/hooks/pre-commit):

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running gitleaks secret scan..."
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose --redact
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Gitleaks found secrets. Commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi
```

Make it executable: chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

This ensures no API keys, passwords, or tokens are ever committed to the repository.
